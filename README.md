## Third-Person Shooter Game Prototype
**Made using Unreal Engine and C++**

This prototype includes various complex gameplay and animation systems.
Some of them are:\
-[A Takedown System](https://github.com/Moktaine/Unreal-Engine-TPS-Game-Prototype/blob/main/Player%20Character/ProjectKeatsCharacter.cpp#L575) that allows the player to shoot during the takedown animation. Also allows player to choose between quickly finishing off the enemy and keep controlling the enemy while shooting other targets.\
-[A Vault System](https://github.com/Moktaine/Unreal-Engine-TPS-Game-Prototype/blob/main/Player%20Character/ProjectKeatsCharacter.cpp#L723) that allows player to perform a vaulting animation on small obstacles like tables. While the vaulting animation plays player has the option to go slow motion and shoot enemies.\
-[A Human Shield System](https://github.com/Moktaine/Unreal-Engine-TPS-Game-Prototype/blob/main/Player%20Character/ProjectKeatsCharacter.cpp#L845) that allows player to take a stunned enemy hostage and use the enemy as human shield. During this state player can shoot enemies without taking damage or finish the enemy off.
